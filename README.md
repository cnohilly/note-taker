# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

This project was to create an application that has backend API to interface with the front end code to create, display and save notes written by the user. The front end code of this project was provided, and the primary code written was the server.js file and small changes in the supplied index.js file to improve functionality or reduce errors. This application utilizes Express.js to be the middleware connecting the front and back end, and saves the notes in a JSON file. This project also had to be deployed live to Heroku.

The starter code supplied can be seen here: [the starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka).
